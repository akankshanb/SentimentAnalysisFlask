Wow... Loved this place.	Good
Crust is not good.	Bad
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	Bad
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	Good
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	Good
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	Bad
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	Bad
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	Bad
The fries were great too.	Good
A great touch.	Good
Service was very prompt.	Good
Would not go back.	Bad
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	Bad
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!	Good
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	Bad
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	Bad
Highly recommended.	Good
Waitress was a little slow in service.	Bad
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	Bad
did not like at all.	Bad
The Burrittos Blah!	Bad
The food, amazing.	Good
Service is also cute.	Good
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	Good
So they performed.	Good
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	Good
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	Bad
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	Good
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	Bad
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	Bad
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	Good
This was like the final blow!	Bad
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	Good
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	Bad
Overall, I like this place a lot.	Good
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	Good
Ample portions and good prices.	Good
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	Bad
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	Good
Service sucks.	Bad
The shrimp tender and moist.	Good
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	Bad
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	Bad
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	Good
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	Bad
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	Good
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	Bad
The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	Good
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	Good
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	Good
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	Good
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	Good
Their chow mein is so good!	Good
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	Bad
The portion was huge!	Good
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	Good
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	Bad
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	Bad
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	Good
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	Bad
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	Bad
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	Good
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	Good
We'd definitely go back here again.	Good
We are so glad we found this place.	Good
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	Good
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	Good
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	Good
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	Bad
A great way to finish a great.	Good
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	Good
- Really, really good rice, all the time.	Good
The service was meh.	Bad
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	Bad
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	Bad
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	Bad
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	Bad
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	Good
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	Good
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	Bad
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	Bad
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	Bad
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	Bad
This place has it!	Good
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	Bad
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	Good
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	Bad
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	Good
Omelets are to die for!	Good
Everything was fresh and delicious!	Good
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	Bad
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.	Good
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!	Bad
Best breakfast buffet!!!	Good
say bye bye to your tip lady!	Bad
We'll never go again.	Bad
Will be back again!	Good
Food arrived quickly!	Good
It was not good.	Bad
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	Good
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	Good
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	Good
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	Good
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	Good
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	Good
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	Good
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	Good
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	Good
Will go back next trip out.	Good
Sooooo good!!	Good
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	Bad
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	Bad
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	Good
Nice, spicy and tender.	Good
Good prices.	Good
Check it out.	Good
It was pretty gross!	Bad
I've had better atmosphere.	Bad
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	Bad
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	Bad
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	Bad
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	Bad
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	Good
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	Good
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	Good
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	Bad
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	Bad
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	Good
I wouldn't return.	Bad
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	Good
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	Bad
Penne vodka excellent!	Good
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	Good
The management is rude.	Bad
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	Good
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	Good
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	Good
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	Good
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	Bad
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	Good
Don't do it!!!!	Bad
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	Bad
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	Bad
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	Bad
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	Good
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	Good
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	Bad
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	Bad
I give it 2 thumbs down	Bad
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	Bad
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	Good
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	Good
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	Bad
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	Bad
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	Good
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	Good
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	Good
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	Good
this place is good.	Good
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	Bad
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	Bad
I was seated immediately.	Good
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	Good
Avoid at all cost!	Bad
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	Good
DELICIOUS!!	Good
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	Good
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	Bad
I've never been treated so bad.	Bad
Bacon is hella salty.	Good
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	Bad
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	Good
The waitresses are very friendly.	Good
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	Good
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	Good
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	Bad
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	Bad
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	Good
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	Good
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	Bad
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	Bad
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	Bad
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	Bad
It was probably dirt.	Bad
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	Good
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	Good
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	Bad
Interesting decor.	Good
What I really like there is the crepe station.	Good
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	Good
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	Good
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	Good
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	Bad
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	Good
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	Bad
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	Good
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	Bad
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	Bad
Very friendly staff.	Good
It is worth the drive.	Good
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	Good
Food was great and so was the serivce!	Good
The warm beer didn't help.	Bad
Great brunch spot.	Good
Service is friendly and inviting.	Good
Very good lunch spot.	Good
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	Bad
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	Bad
Must have been an off night at this place.	Bad
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	Good
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	Bad
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	Bad
My friend loved the salmon tartar.	Good
Won't go back.	Bad
Extremely Tasty!	Good
Waitress was good though!	Good
Soggy and not good.	Bad
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	Good
Which are small and not worth the price.	Bad
- the food is rich so order accordingly.	Good
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	Bad
The service was a bit lacking.	Bad
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	Bad
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	Bad
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	Bad
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	Good
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	Good
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	Good
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	Bad
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	Good
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	Good
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	Bad
Very very fun chef.	Good
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	Bad
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	Good
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	Bad
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."	Bad
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	Good
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	Bad
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	Good
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	Bad
Now this dish was quite flavourful.	Good
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	Bad
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	Bad
"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""	Bad
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	Bad
Seriously flavorful delights, folks.	Good
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	Good
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	Good
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	Bad
Owner's are really great people.!	Good
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	Bad
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.	Good
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	Bad
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	Good
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	Good
Fantastic service here.	Good
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	Bad
They know how to make them here.	Good
very tough and very short on flavor!	Bad
I hope this place sticks around.	Good
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	Bad
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.	Good
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	Good
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	Good
Plus, it's only 8 bucks.	Good
The service was not up to par, either.	Bad
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	Good
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!	Good
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	Bad
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	Good
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	Good
You can't beat that.	Good
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	Good
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	Good
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	Bad
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.	Good
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	Good
I think not again	Bad
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	Bad
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	Good
Service stinks here!	Bad
I waited and waited.	Bad
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	Bad
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	Good
Great Pizza and Salads!	Good
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	Bad
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	Bad
This place is amazing!	Good
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	Bad
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	Bad
Just don't know why they were so slow.	Bad
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	Good
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	Bad
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	Good
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.	Good
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	Bad
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	Good
Never again will I be dining at this place!	Bad
The food was excellent and service was very good.	Good
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	Good
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	Bad
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	Bad
Food was really boring.	Bad
Good Service-check!	Good
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	Bad
Will never, ever go back.	Bad
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	Bad
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	Good
I did not expect this to be so good!	Good
Fantastic food!	Good
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	Bad
The food was very good.	Good
Never going back.	Bad
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	Good
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	Bad
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	Bad
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	Good
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	Good
All the bread is made in-house!	Good
The only downside is the service.	Bad
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	Bad
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	Good
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.	Good
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	Good
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	Good
You won't be disappointed.	Good
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	Good
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	Bad
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	Bad
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	Bad
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	Good
We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.	Good
Everything was gross.	Bad
I love this place.	Good

First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	Bad
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."	Bad
OMG, the food was delicioso!	Good
There is nothing authentic about this place.	Bad
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	Bad
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	Good
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	Good
It's worth driving up from Tucson!	Good
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	Bad
Pretty good beer selection too.	Good
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	Good
Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	Good
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	Good
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	Good
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	Bad
He was terrible!	Bad
Everyone is treated equally special.	Good
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.	Bad
It was delicious!!!	Good
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	Good
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	Bad
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	Good
Best fish I've ever had in my life!	Good
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)	Good
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	Bad
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.	Good
Pretty cool I would say.	Good
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	Bad
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.	Good
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	Bad
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	Bad
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.	Good
The staff are great, the ambiance is great.	Good
He deserves 5 stars.	Good
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	Bad
They dropped more than the ball.	Bad
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	Good
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	Good
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	Bad
Best tacos in town by far!!	Good
I took back my money and got outta there.	Bad
In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.	Good
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	Bad

I won't be back.	Bad
They have great dinners.	Good
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.	Good
The food was terrible.	Bad

I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	Bad
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.	Good
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.	Bad
This is a disgrace.	Bad
Def coming back to bowl next time	Good
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.	Good
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.	Good
I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.	Good
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	Good
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	Good
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	Good
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	Bad
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	Good
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	Good
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	Good
This one is simply a disappointment.	Bad
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	Bad
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	Bad
Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.	Good
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.	Good
Left very frustrated.	Bad
I'll definitely be in soon again.	Good
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	Good
Service was fantastic.	Good
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	Bad

I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	Bad
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	Bad
But now I was completely grossed out.	Bad
I really enjoyed eating here.	Good
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.	Good
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	Good
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	Good
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	Bad
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	Bad
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	Bad
What a mistake that was!	Bad
No complaints!	Good
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	Good
Waiter was a jerk.	Bad
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.	Bad
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	Good
I never come again.	Bad
We loved the biscuits!!!	Good
Service is quick and friendly.	Good
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	Bad
So absolutley fantastic.	Good
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	Bad

I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	Good

I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	Bad
I'd love to go back.	Good
Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.	Good
Nothing special.	Bad
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	Good
Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!	Good
Will not be back.	Bad
Sauce was tasteless.	Bad
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	Good
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.	Good
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	Bad
Food was so gooodd.	Good
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	Bad
I was so insulted.	Bad
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	Bad
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	Bad
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.	Good
Nargile - I think you are great.	Good
Best tater tots in the southwest.	Good
We loved the place.	Good
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	Bad
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.	Good
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.	Good
The manager was the worst.	Bad
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	Good
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	Good
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	Bad
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	Bad
Love the margaritas, too!	Good
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.	Good
Very good, though!	Good

This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.	Good
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	Bad
The selection of food was not the best.	Bad
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	Good
This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.	Good
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	Good

It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	Bad
How awesome is that.	Good
I will be back many times soon.	Good

Those burgers were amazing.	Good
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	Bad

A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	Bad
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	Good
As for the service, I thought it was good.	Good

When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	Good
Once your food arrives it's meh.	Bad

The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	Good
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	Bad

They were golden-crispy and delicious.	Good
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	Bad

For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	Bad
The service here is fair at best.	Bad

Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	Bad
Very poor service.	Bad
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	Bad

I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	Bad
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	Bad

I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	Bad
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	Bad
We definately enjoyed ourselves.	Good
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	Bad

I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	Bad
The service was extremely slow.	Bad
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	Bad
Seriously killer hot chai latte.	Good

My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	Good
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	Good
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	Bad

Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	Bad

Spend your money elsewhere.	Bad
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	Good
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	Bad
And the drinks are WEAK, people!	Bad
-My order was not correct.	Bad
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	Bad
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	Bad
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Good
We won't be returning.	Bad
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	Good
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	Bad
Very, very sad.	Bad
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	Bad
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	Bad
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	Bad
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	Bad

Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	Bad
This place is disgusting!	Bad
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	Good
The RI style calamari was a joke.	Bad
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	Bad
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	Bad
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	Bad
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	Bad
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	Bad
Disappointing experience.	Bad
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	Bad

WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.	Bad
We won't be going back.	Bad
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	Bad
This place lacked style!!	Bad
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	Bad
Don't bother coming here.	Bad
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	Bad
The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	Bad
It was equally awful.	Bad
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	Bad
very slow at seating even with reservation.	Bad
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	Bad
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	Bad
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	Bad
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	Bad
I was VERY disappointed!!	Bad
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	Bad
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	Bad
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	Bad
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	Bad
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	Bad
Con: spotty service.	Bad
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	Bad
But then they came back cold.	Bad
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	Bad
The real disappointment was our waiter.	Bad
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	Bad
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	Bad
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	Bad
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	Bad
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	Bad
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	Bad
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	Bad
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	Bad
But I don't like it.	Bad
Hell no will I go back	Bad
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	Bad
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."	Bad
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	Bad
The ambiance isn't much better.	Bad
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	Bad
The food wasn't good.	Bad
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	Bad
What happened next was pretty....off putting.	Bad
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	Bad
Overpriced for what you are getting.	Bad
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	Bad
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	Bad
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	Bad
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	Bad
Food was below average.	Bad
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	Bad
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	Bad
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	Bad
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	Bad
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	Bad
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	Bad
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	Bad
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	Bad
Spend your money and time some place else.	Bad
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	Bad
the presentation of the food was awful.	Bad
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	Bad
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	Bad
Appetite instantly gone.	Bad
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	Bad
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	Bad
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	Bad
